#
# Generates CHANGELOG sections for a library from its git release tags.
#
# For each release of <library>, prints a dated version heading followed by one
# bullet per commit that touched that library between the previous release and
# this one. Release chores (version bumps, "Release <pkg> X.X.X") are filtered
# out, and `[dagster-foo] ` subject prefixes are stripped since the library is
# implied by the file the entry lives in.
#
# Release tags live on GitHub, so fetch them first:
#
#     git fetch origin --tags
#
# USAGE
#
#     ./scripts/generate_changelog.sh dagster-polars            # print to stdout
#     ./scripts/generate_changelog.sh dagster-polars > out.md   # save for review
#
# The output is a starting point for a maintainer to review and reword, not a
# finished changelog.

# Six libraries were renamed out of `dagster-contrib-*` partway through their
# lives. Their early releases are tagged under the old prefix and their early
# commits touched the old directory, so both have to be searched or those
# releases come back empty. The map is deliberately hardcoded rather than
# derived from `git log --diff-filter=R`: dagster-qdrant is also a rename (of
# `_template`), and following that would pull unrelated template history in.
